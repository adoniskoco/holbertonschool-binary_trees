# Binary Tree Operations - C Project

### Task Descriptions

1. **Filename: `0-binary_tree_node.c`**
   - **Function:** `binary_tree_node`
   - **Description:** Creates a new binary tree node, initializing its value and setting its left and right children to `NULL`.

2. **Filename: `1-binary_tree_insert_left.c`**
   - **Function:** `binary_tree_insert_left`
   - **Description:** Inserts a new node as the left child of a given node in the binary tree.

3. **Filename: `2-binary_tree_insert_right.c`**
   - **Function:** `binary_tree_insert_right`
   - **Description:** Inserts a new node as the right child of a given node in the binary tree.

4. **Filename: `3-binary_tree_delete.c`**
   - **Function:** `binary_tree_delete`
   - **Description:** Deletes an entire binary tree, freeing all allocated memory.

5. **Filename: `4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c`**
   - **Function:** `binary_tree_is_leaf`
   - **Description:** Checks if a given node is a leaf node (i.e., it has no children).

6. **Filename: `5-binary_tree_is_root.c`**
   - **Function:** `binary_tree_is_root`
   - **Description:** Checks if a given node is the root node of the binary tree.

7. **Filename: `6-binary_tree_preorder.c`**
   - **Function:** `binary_tree_preorder`
   - **Description:** Performs a pre-order traversal of the binary tree, visiting the root node first, then recursively visiting the left and right subtrees.

8. **Filename: `7-binary_tree_inorder.c`**
   - **Function:** `binary_tree_inorder`
   - **Description:** Performs an in-order traversal of the binary tree, recursively visiting the left subtree, then the root, and finally the right subtree.

9. **Filename: `8-binary_tree_postorder.c`**
   - **Function:** `binary_tree_postorder`
   - **Description:** Performs a post-order traversal of the binary tree, recursively visiting the left and right subtrees first, then the root node.

10. **Filename: `9-binary_tree_height.c`**
    - **Function:** `binary_tree_height`
    - **Description:** Measures the height of a binary tree, defined as the number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf node.

11. **Filename: `10-binary_tree_depth.c`**
    - **Function:** `binary_tree_depth`
    - **Description:** Measures the depth of a node, which is the number of edges from the node to the root of the tree.

12. **Filename: `11-binary_tree_size.c`**
    - **Function:** `binary_tree_size`
    - **Description:** Measures the size of a binary tree, which is the total number of nodes in the tree.

13. **Filename: `12-binary_tree_leaves.c`**
    - **Function:** `binary_tree_leaves`
    - **Description:** Counts the number of leaves in the binary tree (nodes that have no children).

14. **Filename: `13-binary_tree_nodes.c`**
    - **Function:** `binary_tree_nodes`
    - **Description:** Counts the number of nodes in the binary tree that have at least one child.

15. **Filename: `14-binary_tree_balance.c`**
    - **Function:** `binary_tree_balance`
    - **Description:** Measures the balance factor of a binary tree, which is the difference between the height of the left and right subtrees.

16. **Filename: `15-binary_tree_is_full.c`**
    - **Function:** `binary_tree_is_full`
    - **Description:** Checks if a binary tree is full, meaning every node has either 0 or 2 children.

17. **Filename: `16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c`**
    - **Function:** `binary_tree_is_perfect`
    - **Description:** Checks if a binary tree is perfect, meaning all internal nodes have exactly two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.

18. **Filename: `17-binary_tree_sibling.c`**
    - **Function:** `binary_tree_sibling`
    - **Description:** Finds the sibling of a given node, if it exists.

19. **Filename: `18-binary_tree_uncle.c`**
    - **Function:** `binary_tree_uncle`
    - **Description:** Finds the uncle of a given node, if it exists (the sibling of the node's parent).
